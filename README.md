# 🛡️ Lightweight Multi-Image Encryption Scheme  
## Using Dynamic Chaotic SBox-PBox Based Substitution-Permutation Network

This project implements a **lightweight multi-image encryption scheme** using a dynamic **chaotic Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)** architecture. It includes an interactive dashboard built with **Plotly Dash**, allowing real-time visualization of entropy trajectories, chaotic S-Boxes, and lattice-based P-Box transformations.
